## Smithsonian Mission

Founded in 1846 from the bequest of Englishman James Smithson with the condition: 
> "under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the **increase and diffusion of knowledge**."

## What is the Data Science Lab?

Located in the Smithsonian Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), the OCIO
Data Science Lab acts as a "Lab" in the sense that it is:

* an environment producing high-quality scholarship and training new researchers
* a place to pilot new technologies and techniques with Smithsonian data and processes
